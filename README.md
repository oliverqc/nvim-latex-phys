# nvim-latex-phys
Latex suite from obsidian for LuaSnip on nvim. Snippets only work when placed between $...$. 

# Installation 
Make sure you have LuaSnip installed and are calling your snippets from your desired location. I have my files setup .../LuaSnip/obsdn.lua

# Demo
I use these snippets to type up physics and math notes but you can easily add and remove snippets as you desire.
